    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In general terms, a blockchain is an immutable transaction ledger, maintained within a distributed network of peer nodes. These nodes each maintain a copy of the ledger by applying transactions that have been validated by a consensus protocol, grouped into blocks that include a hash that bind each block to the preceding block.
<br><br>
The first and most widely recognized application of blockchain is the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, though others have followed in its footsteps. Ethereum, an alternative cryptocurrency, took a different approach, integrating many of the same characteristics as Bitcoin but adding smart contracts to create a platform for distributed applications. Bitcoin and Ethereum fall into a class of blockchain that we would classify as public permissionless blockchain technology. Basically, these are public networks, open to anyone, where participants interact anonymously.</p>
